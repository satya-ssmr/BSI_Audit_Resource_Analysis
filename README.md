 **Audit resource allocation report**
This dashboard provides insights into key audit metrics to help guide planning and strategy.

**Metrics that matter
**
_Days booked_ - Shows the number of auditor days booked for upcoming audits. This helps capacity planning.

_Overdue audits_ - Highlights audits that are past their due date. Focusing on reducing overdue audits improves timeliness.

_Utilization of auditors _- Tracks the percentage of an auditor's time spent on billable audits. Higher utilization indicates good capacity usage.

\color _% Remote_ - Shows the percentage of audits being conducted remotely. More remote work can improve flexibility.

_Average time from creation to delivery _- Measures the time from audit creation to completion. Faster cycle time increases responsiveness.

_Planning focus areas _- Insights into where planning should focus to address issues surfaced by the metrics. For example:

This dashboard provides insights into key audit metrics across 4 pages:

**<span style="color:blue">Dashboard 1: Overdue Audits</span>**

Shows audits that have gone past their due date. Includes filtering and highlighting of high priority overdue audits.

Using this page helps focus efforts on completing or extending overdue engagements. It enables prioritization based on client needs.

**<span style="color:green">Dashboard 2: Client Prioritization</span>**
Displays audit hours booked and delivered by client. Clients are ranked based on hours, allowing planning teams to visualize top customers.

This assists account management and forecasting of top customer needs. Helps ensure capacity for strategic client audits.

**<span style="color:red">Dashboard 3: Auditor Utilization</span>**
Tracks utilization of auditors as a percentage of their available time. Low utilization can indicate excess capacity.

Enables planning team to optimize auditor assignments and balance workloads. Helps improve productivity.

**<span style="color:orange">Dashboard 4: Remote Booking</span>
**Percentage of audits conducted fully-remote versus on client site. Indicates adoption of remote/hybrid audit capabilities.

Supports determining needs for technologies, travel, and other policies to enable effective remote auditing.

**Conclusions:**
If overdue audits are increasing, assess causes and tackle process bottlenecks; The dashboard allows us to find out the root cause for the problem
If auditor utilization is low, evaluate ways to increase billable assignments
If cycle time is long, identify inefficiencies in the audit process
